# How to contribute.

If ur code/project has multiple files, create a folder and commit your files in that file. Otherwise, just commit it to the repo. If you want to contribute to sum1 else's project, just submit the changes in a PR and u can ping the original contributor in the PR msg on if they approve of the changes. If they do, it will be merged. If not, well u can change it and try again.
